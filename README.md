This is a quick port of the Windows SDK example for the Magnification API.

There's two versions:

1) The original twinBASIC version, made using WinDevLib, so all APIs/UDTs/etc were already defined.

2) A backported VB6 version, which uses local copies of the defs. It's still 64bit compatible and can readily be imported to tB and compiled for either 32 or 64 bit.
